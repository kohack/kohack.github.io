I'm a Graduate Development Trainee at [Brunei Shell
Petroleum](https://www.bsp.com.bn/main/) assuming the role of Software Engineer
(and more recently, Data Engineer) since I joined the company through its [Shell
Graduate
Programme](https://www.bsp.com.bn/main/careers/students-and-graduates/joining-us-as-graduates#/recruitment)
conducted in the early- to mid-2020.

At the present, my core tasks as a Software Engineer and Data Engineer include
designing software architecture, developing, and maintaining Web applications,
and integrating heterogeneous systems, along with overlooking and working with
remote (outsourced) developers in the implementation, delivery, and maintenance of
a nascent in-house data platform.

I graduated from Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) in early 2019, a few months
before the advent of COVID-19, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
Science. After graduating, I worked briefly at UBD's _[RoboLab
V3](https://ailab.space/robolab/)_ as a research assistant. I would later join
[Datastream Digital (DST)](https://dst.com.bn/our-company/) as a part-time
developer assuming the role of data engineer where I got my first opportunity to
get my hands on multi-node cluster hosting [big
data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) engineering frameworks and tools
like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/),
and [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

I sometimes struggle to pinpoint my specific interests, even after narrowing
them down to the domain of computer science and engineering. Currently, my roles
and day-job involvements have made my direction of interest lean towards the
well-established software engineering field and the more nascent and
rapidly evolving field of data engineering.

I've also found myself picking up the habit of reading books more frequently.
This has also encouraged me to take up the pen (or in this case, the keyboard)
to try out writing. I'm also kindled by the popular idea of _"Write to
Think"_ among creatives -- indeed, writing _is_ thinking; and reading Herbert
Lui's _[Don't Think to Write, Write to
Think](https://herbertlui.net/dont-think-to-write-write-to-think/)_ may move you
to want to do the same.
