Kohack is a blogging platform that aims to facilitate and grow the local
Bruneian writing scene focused on the realm of computer science. We believe that
progress can happen at a much faster rate when people can easily get together to
share and discuss their ideas, problems, and the solutions that they come up
with. We also believe that writing is the best medium to convey your work in its
most accessible, high-quality form.

With Kohack as the open platform, we aim to invite local hackers to write and
blog about things that like-minded computer enthusiasts may find interesting.
Unfortunately, we feel that the culture of creating content (e.g., blogging)
among local hackers has seemingly no presence in Brunei.

When we use the term hacker, we are referring to the more innocent but
uncommon form of its definition: technology enthusiasts who like to overcome
technical problems, usually by employing computers. We prefer to use this term
as it represents our ideals closely; and, it is through the driving force of
this hacker culture ideals that we hope the contents in Kohack are proliferated.

This site is hence the petri dish in our attempt to develop local hacker culture.
