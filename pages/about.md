Kohack is a blogging platform that aims to facilitate and grow the local
Bruneian writing scene focused on the realm of computer science. We believe that
progress can happen at a much faster rate when people can easily get together to
share and discuss their ideas, problems, and the solutions that they come up
with. We also believe that writing is the best medium to convey your work in its
most accessible, high-quality form.

With Kohack as the open platform, we aim to invite local hackers to write and
blog about things that like-minded computer enthusiasts may find interesting.
Unfortunately, we feel that the culture of creating content (e.g., blogging)
among local hackers has seemingly no presence.

When we use the term hacker, what we're referring to is the more innocent but
uncommon form of its definition: technology enthusiasts who like to overcome
technical problems, usually by employing computers. We love to use this term, as
it represents our ideals, and hence the contents we wish to see be proliferated in
Kohack by the local hacker community.

This site is the petri dish in our attempt to develop said culture.
